# beautiful-places-spring-mvc 

Ongoing project based on:
- Spring MVC 4 (+security)
- Hibernate (although with some direct JDBC)
- PostgreSQL
- Gradle as build tool

Additinal features include:
 - Velicity Engine/Template
 - Ehcache for ref data
 - Email sendlist

UI is simply JSP/jstl with a bunch of JavaScript/jQuery. And some ajax, obviously.

And Bootstrap 3 for CSS

Since front-end is not my strong point I used following amazing plugins:
- For map and sidepanels: (https://github.com/Turbo87/sidebar-v2)
- For image upload: (http://plugins.krajee.com/file-input)
- multiselect bootstrap feature: http://davidstutz.github.io/bootstrap-multiselect/

Country list in xml/json was taken from this project:
